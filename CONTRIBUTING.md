## Testing

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **API Tests**: Test backend endpoints

### Writing Tests

```typescript
// Example unit test
import { formatTime } from '@/utils/helpers'

describe('formatTime', () => {
  it('formats seconds correctly', () => {
    expect(formatTime(125)).toBe('02:05')
  })
  
  it('handles zero correctly', () => {
    expect(formatTime(0)).toBe('00:00')
  })
})
```
