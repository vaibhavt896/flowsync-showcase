# 🔊 FlowSync Ticking Sound Setup

Your productivity app now has a **simplified ticking sound system** that automatically plays background sounds during focus sessions.

## ✅ **How It Works**

1. **Start Timer**: Click "Start Focus" button
2. **Ticking Plays**: Clock ticking sound automatically starts 
3. **Continuous Loop**: Sound loops until you pause/stop the timer
4. **Auto Stop**: Sound stops when session ends or is paused

## 🎛️ **Settings**

Go to **Settings** → **Ticking Sound** section:

- **Sound Selection**: Choose from available ticking sounds or "No Sound"
- **Volume Control**: Adjust volume from 0-100%  
- **Sound Toggle**: Master on/off switch
- **Preview**: Test sounds before applying

## 📁 **Your Audio Files**

Currently loaded sounds:
- ✅ **School Bell**: `/sounds/alarms/school-bell-199584.mp3`
- ✅ **Clock Ticking**: `/sounds/ticking/clock-ticking-sound-effect-240503.mp3` 

The system is set to use your clock ticking sound by default.
